title: Picking the right framework
published: false

Or more aptly, as it usually turns out to be, picking the 
_perfect_ framework. Picking the perfect language, the perfect
framework, perfect library, perfect platform, perfect 
widget library, you get the idea.  

Perfect framework is the one you choose today or tommorrow,
not the one you choose in a month after timeless debate that
leads no where.

Notes:
1. Include picking a framework that satisfies your
requirements, if you don't know the requirements you
need to figure those out first
2. Don't settle on one framework/library, try them both
now a days every framework has a 5-10 minute tutorial,
complete it to get an idea of how things work
3. Check the community, to figure out the pain points,
don't spend too much time doing this, if you cannot
find something quickly then it isn't a big deal
4. Aslong as the framework applies common design patterns,
the code you write, that adds value to the organization
is portable and transferrable.
