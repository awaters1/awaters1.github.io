title: Picking the right framework

Or more aptly, as it usually turns out to be, picking the 
_perfect_ framework. Picking the perfect language, the perfect
framework, perfect library, perfect platform, perfect 
widget library, you get the idea.  

Perfect framework is the one you choose today or tommorrow,
not the one you choose in a month after timeless debate that
leads no where.

Selecting a framework should center around these three topics:

1. __Requirements__: Pick the framework that satisfies your 
requirements, if you don't know what your requirements are
then you need to figure those out first, no framework will help
in that case.
2. __Community__: Look at the forums and observe
the popular topics and determine the pain points.  Don't spend
too much time here though, every framework has wrinkles, but 
can you function with those wrinkles is what you want to find out.
3. __Design Patterns__: 
-Also include something about the framework feeling familiar, don't want
to go to something too radical to begin with, but save it for later
to research as an alternative
-As long as the framework applies common design patterns,
the code you write, that adds value to the organization
is portable and transferrable.

Lastly, don't get too hung up on choosing a framework
on the first day.  These days every framework has a
quick 5-10 minute tutorial that do a decent job
of introducing you to the major components.
