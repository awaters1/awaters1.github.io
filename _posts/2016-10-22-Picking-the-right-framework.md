title: Picking the right framework

Or more aptly, as it usually turns out to be, picking the 
_perfect_ framework. Picking the perfect language, the perfect
framework, perfect library, perfect platform, perfect 
widget library, you get the idea.  

Perfect framework is the one you choose today or tommorrow,
not the one you choose in a month after timeless debate that
leads no where.

Selecting a framework should center around these three topics:

1. __Requirements__: Pick the framework that satisfies your 
requirements, if you don't know what your requirements are
then you need to figure those out first, no framework will help
in that case.
2. __Community__: Look at the forums and observe
the popular topics and determine the pain points.  Don't spend
too much time here though, every framework has wrinkles, but 
whether you can function with those wrinkles is what you want to find out.
3. __Design Patterns__:  The framework should also feel familiar, meaning
that it uses design patterns present in the alternatives.  The patterns
 should also make sense and have real benefits. 
 As long as the framework applies common design patterns,
the code you write, that adds value to the organization
is portable and transferrable.  Be careful with choosing something
that may be too radical,  however, I would save it for later
to research as a topic to learn about.

Lastly, don't get too hung up on choosing a framework
on the first day.  These days every framework has a
quick 5-10 minute tutorial that will do a decent job
of introducing you to the major components that should
set you on your way.
