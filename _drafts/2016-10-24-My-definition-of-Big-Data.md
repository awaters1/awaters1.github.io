title: My Definition of Big Data
published: true
---

When I first started at my most recent job everyone
talked about Big Data, Big Data this, Big Data that,
do you have Big Data experience? I was dumb founded,
I never actually heard of Big Data so I was all ears.
Little did I know at that time they were just as clue less
but doing a better job than me of faking it 'till they made it.



So what is my definiton of Big Data? Well to be honest it
is data that once you start working with it you
think to your self "damn that is a lot".  Too much for your
crappy Internet, too fast for your spinning rust and
too complex for you quad core CPU that you thought
could handle anything.
