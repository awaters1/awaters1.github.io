title: Looking at the Big Picture
published: true

The big picture is more than just a buzz word, it needs
to be evaluated to ensure that your team is on
the best path forward. Evaluation needs to be ongoing
as the demands of the marketplace are continually changing.
One thing you want to avoid is getting caught looking left
when everyone else is already walking right.

When I talk about the big picture I am referring
to the higher level evaluation of projects that
typically isn't seen in industry these days.
The three main things that should be evaluated are

1. Are the resources that are currently allocated to 
the project the best fit? Personnel changes are never
an easy task but they still need to be evaluated
2. Are the current tools and frameworks that were
chosen in the past working out for your team?
Have additional tools been discovered that will
increase productivity?
3. Do the long term goals of the project still
align with the organization? Are there opportunities
to pivot the project to better suit the organization?
